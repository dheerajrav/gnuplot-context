Lua generic terminal

 * support color palettes (low priority, not really needed for TikZ?)
 * support enhanced text mode (low priority, not really needed for TikZ)
 * alpha channel support for image data (need to have a look)?
   EAM: Seems to work already.  Did you have an example that fails?
   PH: See http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.4/rgbalpha.html

TikZ backend

 * alpha channel support for image data (need to have a look)?
   EAM: The demos for transparency seem to work already
   PH: See http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.4/rgbalpha.html
 * automatic detection of font sizes (via LaTeX test call?! very low
   priority. It works with the gnuplottex package and the charsize option,
   see style file for an example)
